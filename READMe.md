## About
Bluetooth is a fascinating concept. With my curiosity about Bluetooth, I wanted to have control over how I can implement that in a personal project of mine. Though this a simple project it is amazing that I was able to use the power of Bluetooth to create a switch to turn an LED on and off. This project uses an HC-05 Bluetooth module and LEDs.
